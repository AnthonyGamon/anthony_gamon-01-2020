Hi Mekinah,

I hope you are having a great day so far! 

My name is Anthony and I am one of the developers working on getting your website ready for it's launch this Wednesday! I know you've been working with Marcus on this and it looks like I just missed him for the day so I wanted to reach out to you directly to get to get the final touches done for it's launch. 

Whenever you have a few minutes can you please send me over the photos and a few paragraphs about the business for the "About Us" page?

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call directly at 316-871-6228 or email me at anthonygamon@icloud.com, if I don't hear from you or Marcus on getting the photos and paragraphs I'll give you a quick call in the morning. 

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards, 

Anthony
